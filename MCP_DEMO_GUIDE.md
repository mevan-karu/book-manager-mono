# Demo Guide: Vibe Deploy a 3-Tier Application in Choreo

## Overview

This demo showcases how to vibe deploy a complete 3-tier application on WSO2 Choreo platform using the Book Manager application as an example.

### Application Architecture

The Book Manager application is a modern 3-tier web application that demonstrates full-stack development and deployment on the Choreo platform. The application consists of:

- **book-manager-app (Presentation Tier)**: A React-based Single Page Application (SPA)
- **book-manager-service (Logic Tier)**: A Go-based REST API service that handles business logic and data operations
- **Database (Data Tier)**: A PostgreSQL database that stores book information and user data

This application allows users to perform create, list and delete operations on a book collection, providing a practical example of how modern web applications can be deployed and managed in a cloud-native environment.

### High-Level Demo Flow

This demonstration follows a structured approach to showcase Choreo MCP server's capabilities:

1. **Create New Project** - Create a new project called "book-manager" in Choreo
2. **Create Service Component** - Set up the book-manager-service in Choreo using the repository's `/book-manager-service` directory
3. **Provision PostgreSQL Database** - Create a managed PostgreSQL database server through Choreo's database services
4. **Publish the Default Database to Marketplace** - Publish the default database instance in the provisioned database server to the marketplace  
5. **Create Database Connection** - Create a connection between the book-manager-service and the PostgreSQL database
6. **Build and Re-deploy Service** - Trigger a new build and deployment of the book-manager-service with database connectivity
7. **Test Service with Test-Key** - Validate API functionality using a test-key
8. **Create Managed Auth Enabled SPA Component** - Deploy the book-manager-app as a Single Page Application with built-in authentication enabled
9. **Connect book-manager-app to book-manager-service** - Create a connection between the book-manager-app and the book-manager-service
10. **Add Sample User to IdP** - Configure a test user in Choreo's built-in Identity Provider for authentication testing
11. **Try out the Book Manager Application** - Access and test the deployed web application using the configured test user to demonstrate end-to-end functionality
